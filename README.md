To Run
-------------

In [Blender](http://www.blender.org/), import and select the eyeglasses SVG, and then run the script.

Try it with an [example SVG](http://sethtaylor.com/b2/2013/09/02/free-vector-glasses-icon/)!

The script accepts a variety of parameters, such as a the `desired_width` of the frame,
the `desired_thickness` of the frame, the `bend_degree` for the bend of the lens area.
The script also accepts a `bridge_width` to better gauge how to bend the lens areas.

This version of `pince-nez` is based on actual frame specs
and the resulting design is much closer to real frames than the previous version.
The automated nosepad creation is a best guess and can be refined.

Beveled grooves need to be manually added to insert lenses.
